# AoE DE Bot

## Setup

1. Install [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
2. Copy `config.sample.json` to `config.json` if needed.
3. Configure the Tesseract executable path by either:
   - setting the `tesseract_path` value in `config.json`, or
   - setting the `TESSERACT_CMD` environment variable to the executable path.

If neither option is provided, `pytesseract` will attempt to find `tesseract` on the system `PATH`.

## Configuration notes

The bot locates the minimap on the screen to establish an anchor for HUD
offset calculations. This anchor no longer limits the capture areaâ€”frames are
grabbed from the whole screen unless a different region is explicitly
requested.

HUD-related coordinates, such as `areas.pop_box`, are specified as
``[x, y, width, height]`` fractions of the full screen. These values are
interpreted relative to the screen; the minimap anchor is only used to adjust
offsets when necessary.

## Capturing `hud_resources.png`

Some HUD layouts place the minimap and the resource bar at different offsets.
The bot now searches for either element, so a suitable `hud_resources.png`
template is required for your configuration.

1. Set the game's UI scale to 100%.
2. Take a screenshot of the in-game HUD.
3. Crop a tight image around the resource bar and save it as
   `assets/hud_resources.png`.
4. If your layout differs between profiles, capture and replace this template
   for each one to ensure `wait_hud()` can anchor correctly.
