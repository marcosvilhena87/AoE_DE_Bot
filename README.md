# AoE DE Bot

## Setup

1. Install [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
2. Copy `config.sample.json` to `config.json` if needed.
3. Configure the Tesseract executable path by either:
   - setting the `tesseract_path` value in `config.json`, or
   - setting the `TESSERACT_CMD` environment variable to the executable path.

If neither option is provided, `pytesseract` will attempt to find `tesseract` on the system `PATH`.

## Configuration notes

The bot locates the minimap on the screen to establish an anchor for HUD
offset calculations. This anchor no longer limits the capture areaâ€”frames are
grabbed from the whole screen unless a different region is explicitly
requested.

HUD-related coordinates, such as `areas.pop_box`, are specified as
``[x, y, width, height]`` fractions of the full screen. These values are
interpreted relative to the screen; the minimap anchor is only used to adjust
offsets when necessary.
