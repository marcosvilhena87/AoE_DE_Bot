# AoE DE Bot

## Setup

1. Install [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
2. Copy `config.sample.json` to `config.json` if needed.
3. Configure the Tesseract executable path by either:
   - setting the `tesseract_path` value in `config.json`, or
   - setting the `TESSERACT_CMD` environment variable to the executable path.

If neither option is provided, `pytesseract` will attempt to find `tesseract` on the system `PATH`.

## Configuration notes

The bot detects the HUD by matching a single template of the resource bar
(`assets/resources.png`). This image is also used to read the individual
resource icons. Frames are captured from the whole screen unless a different
region is explicitly requested.

HUD-related coordinates, such as `areas.pop_box`, use ``[x, y, width, height]``
fractions of the entire screen. The default values in `config.json` are
placeholders and should be calibrated for your setup.

The `resource_panel` uses a span-based ROI builder that measures the gap between consecutive icons. `max_width` caps the width of each region when the gap is wide. If the gap is smaller than `min_width`, the ROI shrinks to fit the available space. The `min_width` option accepts either a single value applied to all icons or a list of six per-icon values.

### OCR tuning

Two fields in `config.json` allow adjusting how resource numbers are read:

* `ocr_kernel_size` – size of the square kernel used for morphological dilation
  before running OCR (default `2`).
* `ocr_psm_list` – list of Tesseract [page segmentation modes](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/ImproveQuality.html#page-segmentation-method)
  tried in order when extracting digits (default `[6, 7, 8, 10, 13]`).

## Capturing `assets/resources.png`

`assets/resources.png` is the only template needed for HUD detection and
resource icon recognition. The previous `hud_resources.png` file is no longer
used.

1. Set the game's UI scale to 100%.
2. Take a screenshot of the in-game HUD.
3. Crop a tight image around the resource bar and save it as
   `assets/resources.png`.
4. If your layout differs between profiles, capture and replace this template
   for each one to ensure `wait_hud()` can anchor correctly.

## Resource Icons

The HUD displays resource icons from left to right in the following order:

`wood → food → gold → stone → population → idle villager`

`assets/resources.png` must follow this arrangement so the bot can correctly
locate each value.

### ROI padding and spacing

ROIs are generated by the `compute_resource_rois` utility, which fills the span
between each pair of icons after applying the padding values
described below. The region of interest (ROI) used to read each number sits
between two icons. Three configuration options define the valid horizontal
  area. Each option accepts a list of six values corresponding to the icons in
  the order `wood`, `food`, `gold`, `stone`, `population` and `idle villager`:

* `roi_padding_left` – pixels added to the right edge of the current icon.
* `roi_padding_right` – pixels subtracted from the left edge of the next icon.
* `icon_trim_pct` – fraction of the icon slot to skip when estimating ROIs
  from the HUD anchor.
* `idle_roi_extra_width` – extra pixels appended to the idle villager span to
  capture digits.

Adjust individual entries in the padding arrays when a specific resource needs
more or less space. Increasing `roi_padding_left` or decreasing
`roi_padding_right` widens the available span; the opposite values tighten it.

For a given resource the horizontal bounds are computed as:

```
available_left = icon_right + roi_padding_left[i]
available_right = next_icon_left - roi_padding_right[i]
```

With icon positions `0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150`, icon width `5` and paddings
`left=2` and `right=2`, the calculations look like:

| Resource       | icon_right | next_icon_left | available_left | available_right |
|----------------|-----------:|---------------:|---------------:|----------------:|
| wood           | 5          | 30             | 7              | 28              |
| food           | 35         | 60             | 37              | 58              |
| gold           | 65         | 90             | 67              | 88              |
| stone          | 95         | 120            | 97              | 118             |
| population     | 125        | 150            | 127            | 148             |
| idle villager* | –          | –              | (ROI extends past icon by `idle_roi_extra_width`) |            |

`*` Idle villager is the last icon; its ROI extends beyond the icon by
`idle_roi_extra_width` pixels.

#### Calibrating per-icon offsets

| Icon              | `roi_padding_left[i]` measurement                               | `roi_padding_right[i]` measurement                              | `icon_trim_pct[i]` measurement                                                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| wood_stockpile    | pixels from wood icon's right edge to first digit              | pixels from last digit to food icon's left edge                 | width of wood icon and left spacing divided by total slot width                               |
| food_stockpile    | pixels from food icon's right edge to first digit              | pixels from last digit to gold icon's left edge                 | width of food icon and left spacing divided by slot width                                      |
| gold_stockpile    | pixels from gold icon's right edge to first digit              | pixels from last digit to stone icon's left edge                | width of gold icon and left spacing divided by slot width                                      |
| stone_stockpile   | pixels from stone icon's right edge to first digit             | pixels from last digit to population icon's left edge           | width of stone icon and left spacing divided by slot width                                     |
| population_limit  | pixels from population icon's right edge to first digit        | pixels from last digit to idle villager icon's left edge        | width of population icon and left spacing divided by slot width                               |
| idle_villager     | not used (ROI extends past icon)                              | not used                                                       | width of idle villager icon and left spacing divided by slot width (used only for HUD fallback) |

Use a screenshot editor to count pixels or run `python tools/roi_calibrator.py`
to compute the `icon_trim_pct` values interactively.

### Customizing required icons

The bot determines which HUD icons must be read through the `hud_icons`
section in `config.json`:

```json
"hud_icons": {
  "required": ["wood_stockpile", "food_stockpile", "gold_stockpile", "stone_stockpile", "population_limit", "idle_villager"],
  "optional": []
}
```

Entries in `required` cause the bot to raise an error when any of those icons
cannot be detected or read. Icons listed under `optional` are attempted but do
not stop execution if they are missing. Adjust these lists to match the
resources shown in your game profile.

## Calibration helper

To calibrate the `areas.pop_box` fractions interactively, run:

```
python tools/calibrate_pop_box.py
```

The script waits for the HUD to be detected, shows a screenshot, and lets you
draw the population box. The normalized `[x, y, width, height]` values are
printed and you can choose to write them back to `config.json` automatically.
