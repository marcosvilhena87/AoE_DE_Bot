A unit is a player-controlled, individual entity in the Age of Empires series. Representing a fundamental aspect of gameplay, units feature in all titles, their forms ranging from domesticated animals, humans, ships, siege engines, mythical creatures, to artificial constructs. In every game, units have a color scheme to them, with the color matching that of the team they belong to, unless they are neutral.

Each unit variant possesses certain and/or unique abilities, offering a specific function and role in gameplay. The four main types of unit are: economic, military, hero, and animal. In the spin-off Age of Mythology, myth units are also present.

Most units can move, which sets them apart from buildings, the other critical entity to feature in all titles of the series.
